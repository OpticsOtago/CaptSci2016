This one, found near Middlemarch in North Otago, looks a lot like the Sphynx of Egypt which is quite apt as it is found near the derelict site of the Army training grounds. It is made from a metamorphic type of rock called schist which is formed under the ground by heat from magma, or the collision from tectonic plates.  All the great earthquake action that we have plus erosion brings these rocks to the surface where wind and rain erode them away again. You can see the layers where the rock was formed over time - and these layers contain white quartz and mica.",Jeanna Rodgers,amateur,Adult Amateur,

000020.JPG,,I zoomed in on the moon in the early hours of the day because it is not too bright or too dark so you can see all of the craters and the detail. The reason we can see all of the details is because the Sun's Rays are reflecting onto it and then onto earth so we can see them. Also you can zoom up really far on the camera which also helps to see more detail.

000033.jpg,,"Why the snow look white<br /> <br /> Snow is a pile of individual ice crystals gathered together. When a light photon enters a layer of snow, it goes through an ice crystal on the top, which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal, which does the same thing. Similarly, all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile. It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies, so all colours of light are bounced back out. The combined ""colour"" of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum is white.",Juby Joseph,amateur,Adult Amateur,
000034.jpg,,Fog is tiny droplets of water suspended in air. It occurs when air reaches it dew point - this is the point when cooled air is unable to hold any more moisture so the moisture condenses forming the tiny droplets that become suspended in the air around us. It often forms in Central Otago because of  temperature inversion. The cold dense air settles into parts of the valley and is trapped by the warm air above. It is sometimes called Valley fog and can last for days in calm conditions. I,Emma Guglietta,amateur,Adult Amateur,
000035.jpg,,Snow crystals form when tiny cloud droplets freeze. Snow flakes (polycrystals) are formed by tens to hundreds of these snow crystals.

000038.jpg,,"To be honest this photograph contains four different parts. It has clouds, reflection, stars and The Aurora Australis(Aka southern lights). <br />  <br /> The first part, closest to the ground is the reflection of the stars and aurorae. Reflection is quite a simple concept. It's just the light isn't absorbed. That’s how mirrors work. Next, another layer from the ground is clouds. Clouds are basically water droplets or ice, depending on the cloud height itself. The ice or water gathers around dust particles in the air. Without them condensation wouldn't be possible. So, the way that your windows fog up on a cold morning is like a little cloud on your window. Next are stars, which are very simple. They're just gigantic balls of gas that perform the fusing of 4 hydrogen atoms into helium. And finally, Aurora Australis.  Which are just charged particles from the sun, letting off their energy.",Ben Hawke,youth,Youth,

000042.JPG,,"This photo was taken in Bannockburn with the Carrick Range in the background. In the photo it shows heavy rain clouds and also a partial rainbow. Rain clouds form when the water vapor in normal clouds becomes too heavy to hold, which then makes the droplets fall or precipitate. The photo also shows a storm front encroaching over the Carrick Range. Storm Fronts are usually followed by 'stratus cloud formations' which carry rain or snow (which you can see these behind the front). This is dependent on how high or low these clouds are. The low lying clouds bring rain because they are closer to the heat of the earth and high clouds bring snow because they are further away. The rainbow in the photo is caused by when light is bent or refracted inside a water droplet/rain and then reflected back out creating an arced shaped colour spectrum.",Kasey Short,youth,Youth,

An additional aid to navigation came in the shape of lighthouses. Originally nothing more than fires built on hilltops, the light emitted from the system of lights and lenses of lighthouses warn of unseen dangers and signal safe entry into harbours.

000047.jpg,,"This almost perfect rainbow arc was captured over Lake Brunner. We see rainbows when the sun is behind us and rain is falling in front of us. Raindrops act like prisms when sunlight strikes them - effectively separating the light into its different wavelengths. When sunlight hits a raindrop the sunlight is refracted - or has its direction changed - by the drop of water. The light travels into the raindrop, but when it reaches the back it is reflected to the front of the drop. When it reaches the front once more, it is again refracted and emerges from the raindrop as the colour spectrum we see in a rainbow. If the beam of sunlight is reflected twice inside the raindrop, a secondary rainbow will appear when the light leaves the raindrop (just visible on the left side above Moana). The colours of a secondary rainbow are reversed.",Noelle Bennett,amateur,Adult Amateur,

The small and large Magellanic Clouds have been known since the first millennium in western Asia and served as important navigation markers to the Polynesians. Looking like fragments of the Milky Way to the naked eye, they are actually dwarf spiral galaxies that orbit our own Milky Way. They are connected to each other and to our galaxy by streams of neutral hydrogen. Aside from the myriad of stars in this image, we also have an aurora. The dominant green colour results from incoming electrons colliding with oxygen atoms (22% of the atmosphere). This 'excites' the electrons in the oxygen atoms making them take quantum jumps. When they resettle, they emit light at a single frequency which we see as green. And this light remains perfectly arranged as it is reflected in the flat, smooth creek running along the beach.",Noelle Bennett,amateur,Adult Amateur,

If left to expose for months, at a very low sensitivity, the sun will appear as a concentric series of luminescent lines, some broken by cloudy weather, each day tracing a slightly different arc as the year progresses. The result is a record of the sun’s movement in the sky and it’s interaction with landscape, weather and sea.

The energy from the sun heats up the water on the surface of the Earth, which then evaporates and rises until it cools and condenses - this is when the small drops of water vapour combine into bigger drops and how clouds are formed. Eventually, when enough of the water droplets have combined, they get heavy enough that the air can no longer hold them up - they then fall from the sky as rain. As the rain falls, white light (sunlight) enters the raindrops and its component colours are refracted at different angles. Thus, each raindrop acts as a tiny prism and the colour components separate (disperse) to create the beautiful rainbow pictured here.",Helen Prime,amateur,Adult Amateur,

000076.jpg,,"Storm cell: A storm cell is an air mass with convective loops of both updrafts and downdrafts, which moves as a single mass.  Convection is caused by the sun warming the Earth, which leads to the less dense warm air rising up, into the cooler air.  This movement creates powerful currents.  As the warm air rises and cools, the water vapour it contains begins to condense and form clouds.  If there is enough instability in the atmosphere, cumulonimbus clouds may develop, and may continue to develop into storm cells.

000174.jpg,,"This photo was taken in one of the Waitomo caves, it displays some of the layers of earth and some stalactites formed over many years. Stalactites and stalagmites are formed by water dripping or flowing from fractures on the ceiling of a cave . They are the most common types of speleothems in caves.",Jabari Vink,youth,Youth,
000175.jpg,,"This photo was taken at the start of the Abel Tasman National Park. This photo shows coastal erosion and how water has started to wash the ground away from the bridge. Coastal erosion is the wearing away of land and the removal of beach or dune sediments by wave action, tidal currents, wave currents, drainage or high winds.",Jabari Vink,youth,Youth,

000177.jpg,,"Valleys are formed through glaciation processes. Glaciation is when a shaft of ice, called a glacier, slides down a valley and carves away rock from the sides of the valley. Lake Mackenzie was created by a glacier, shown in this picture.  ",Devon Allen,youth,Youth,
000178.jpg,,Erosion is the breaking down of the earth. In this picture you can see the rocks on the beach and the cliffs that have been affected by natural wind and water erosion. Stewart Island is susceptible to erosion as it is an island with rocky moraine cliffs ,Devon Allen,youth,Youth,
000179.JPG,,"In front of Scott base, Antarctica , the ice shelf meets the sea ice. The sea ice is frozen in place however the ice shelf continues to move. This moving ice puts pressure on the frozen sea ice. Eventually, the sea ice will break pushing the ice upwards in an effort to reduce the pressure coming from the ice shelf. This results in pressure ridges, which continue to change as the ice shelf pushes more of the sea ice upwards. Here is one particular structure of the pressure ridge where the sea ice has overlapped and a significant section of ice has been pushed upwards.",Emma Douma,amateur,Adult Amateur,
000180.JPG,,"An ice sheet will move down the land toward the ocean, much like a river. Once the sheet has reached the ocean an ice shelf is formed. This is the section of the ice sheet floating on the water. As the water melts some of the ice away from the bottom of the ice shelf, the integrity of the shelf is compromised and 'small' sections will break off. These are known as ice bergs. In winter the top layer of the ocean will freeze, creating a layer of sea ice. This will capture anything in its path and here we can see an iceberg that got caught during the freezing process. It is now trapped in the sea ice where it will remain until the ice melts or the currents push it free.",Emma Douma,amateur,Adult Amateur,
000181.JPG,,"When an ice shelf encounters sea ice there will be a build up of pressure. The ice shelf is being pushed further out into the water by the flowing ice sheet behind it, while the sea ice in front of it tries to block its path. As the sea ice is much thinner than the ice shelf, the sea ice will break under the pressure and be forced upwards into a formation known as pressure ridges. Seals can take advantage of these structures as there will be a hole available for them to enter and exit the water. Here we have one such seal enjoying some hard earned sunshine before her next forage. Most seals will give birth near these structures where there are less predators (the holes in the ice are not big enough for a whale to use).",Emma Douma,amateur,Adult Amateur,
